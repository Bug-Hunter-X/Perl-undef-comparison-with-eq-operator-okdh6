This repository demonstrates a common Perl error involving comparing an undefined variable using the 'eq' operator.  The 'bug.pl' file contains the erroneous code, while 'bugSolution.pl' provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from Perl's loose handling of undefined values in string comparisons. Using 'defined' before the comparison is the recommended practice to prevent unexpected outcomes.
